<h1 align="center">ICU Mortality prediction</h1>

## Motivations
Predicting ICU mortality rates from the [Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III](https://mimic.mit.edu/) dataset. As part of a group project for the Healthcare and Medical Analytics module, the project tested and evaluated different models for predicting mortality of patients at the ICU. The predictions were based on 22 vital sign measurements 6, 12 and 24 hours after the patient has been admitted into the ICU, demographic variables (e.g. gender and ethnicity) and health-related variables (e.g. whether a patient is a smoker, has diabetes). The performance of the four models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Adaboosted model and Gradient Boosted models - on predicting mortality was thoroughly examined and discussed.

The PDF and attached code aims to showcase some of the prediction and data science work done within the MSc Business Analytics course at Imperial College London.

## About the Dataset
The MIMIC III dataset is a rich healthcare dataset collected from the critical care units from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts between 2001 and 2012. The database documented features such as demographics and vital sign measurements for 53,423 hospital admissions for 38,597 patients of 16 and over.
