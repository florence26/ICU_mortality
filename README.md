<h1 align="center">ICU Mortality prediction</h1>

## Motivations
Predicting ICU mortality rates from the [Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III](https://mimic.mit.edu/) dataset. As part of a group project for the Healthcare and Medical Analytics module, the project tested and evaluated different models for predicting mortality of patients at the ICU. The predictions were based on 22 vital sign measurements 6, 12 and 24 hours after the patient has been admitted into the ICU, demographic variables (e.g. gender and ethnicity) and health-related variables (e.g. whether a patient is a smoker, has diabetes). The performance of the four models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Adaboosted model and Gradient Boosted models - on predicting mortality was thoroughly examined and discussed.

The PDF and attached code aims to showcase some of the prediction and data science work done within the MSc Business Analytics course.
